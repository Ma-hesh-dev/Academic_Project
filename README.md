Project Title: Early-stage Thyroid prediction using Machine learning techniques

Techstack:Numpy, Pandas, sckit-learn, Algorithms, ML Techniques, Jupyter note book, Python.
Trained various models to predict the HypoThyroid in the early stage with 80:20 ratio(80%of data to train the model and 20% for testing).
Compared different machine learning techniques across different performance measures
Achieved an Accuracy of 98%.
